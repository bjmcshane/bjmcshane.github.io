Current bug list:
- can't use the Helvetica Neue font face for some unknown reason. Some weird import bug that I thought was due to pathing but apparently doesn't impact the other two font faces. Something to do with ttf?
- The contact-link fading is bugged in components/Sidebar/index.scss. For whatever reason it won't display the 'CONTACT' text while hovering over the link. No issue with other two, some problem in index.js?
