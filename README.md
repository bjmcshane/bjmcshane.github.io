Current bug list:
- can't use the Helvetica Neue font face for some unknown reason. Some weird import bug that I thought was due to pathing but apparently doesn't impact the other two font faces. Something to do with ttf?
- useEffect in components/Home/useEffect makes the whole page blank and won't pring any errors in a try catch (~41:00)
- I'm skipping over the pacman loading animation (~1:03:00)
- the contact form was hovering over all the text on the page, coulnd't figure out why so I just added a much larger margin-top part

TODO:
- find something to throw on the right side of the Home page, do it correctly, resume doesnt seem to be working

- make sure contact page is formatted correctly with the <body> and <h1> tags
